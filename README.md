# pythulhu
My knowledge of the thing began in the winter of 1926â€“27 with the
death of my grand-uncle George Gammell Angell, Professor Emeritus of
Semitic Languages in Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island. Professor
Angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions, and had
frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums; so that
his passing at the age of ninety-two may be recalled by many. Locally,
interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death.

## The Demos
```

    if demo == 0:
        Hello()
    elif demo == 1:
        print Deep()
    elif demo == 2:
        print Last(Concat(Iota(), Iota(), Just(888)))
    elif demo == 3:
        print Sum(Balanced())
    elif demo == 4:
        print Sum(AlwaysFinally(0, 1066))
    elif demo == 5:
        print Max(Repeating([19, 23, 31]))
    elif demo == 6:
        print Sum(Concat(AlwaysFinally(+1, 1000), MoreAlwaysFinally(-1, 66)))
    elif demo == 7:
        print Sum(Repeating([+1, -1]))
    else:
        print "UNKNOWN DEMO: %s" % demo
